                  Words can not describe how grateful I am for this entire surreal
                  experience from sharing my experience, mentoring over 60+
                  participants across India and even abroad to learning new
                  things! This workshop has taught me that if you have the skills
                  and wish to embrace yourself then nothing is better than helping
                  out others and appreciating yourself rather than doubting your
                  capabilities and achievements. The enthusiasm showed by each of
                  the participants and their willingness to learn by attending
                  each class faithfully inspired me to do better by putting my
                  best efforts into making presentations, planning fun challenges,
                  syllabus, concepts, and sharing my strategies and skills to
                  bring out their creativity and work up their subconscious minds.
                  So grateful to the entire team of the Education Outreach
                  Programme for providing me with a platform where my skills are
                  not only appreciated but a platform where I can connect with
                  students and professionals in a much more impactful way! The
                  program managers and moderators were always present throughout
                  the meet to moderate and help me out to manage the class.
                  Moreover coordinated everything I had to inform the students and
                  made the entire process smoother by supporting and being
                  involved in everything to make sure no one has any
                  inconvenience.

                  1st of all Great learning from these sessions. <br />
                  I am doing my internship in digital marketing in an
                  organisation. Initially I was struggling with my content
                  writing. This course turned out to be an eye opener. On the 1st
                  day Devika shared her experience on content writing, it was a
                  great opportunity to understand the mistakes that I had done
                  earlier. Then she gave me the insights of what a content should
                  be and what not. We also had great activities and I personally
                  liked the three word activity, where my creativity had gone to
                  an insane level :P I said "My perfume was hiding under the
                  pillow cover". Oh sorry! I didn't tell you the words. The words
                  were pillow, cover and perfume. I missed a day and they talked
                  about Email marketing, that was a major gap and Devika filled
                  the gap with a 15 mins overview of it. THANK YOU (in caps)
                  Devika for sharing your experience! Thank you EOP team for
                  making this course happen:)

                  Hi, I am Arpita Suza Jacob It was a great time studying with
                  Kanak mam. Although I have already learnt this topic, I have
                  learnt new concepts from this one week session. The class was
                  also very interactive. Thank you for this opportunity.

                  Hello! This is Pragya. I had joined the frontend web development
                  workshop held for 7 days. The sessions by our mentor Kanak
                  Sengar were really amazing! She did a great job with solving our
                  doubts. She allowed us to be frank with her unlike most other
                  conventional teachers. I have learned HTML in class 10th and
                  after listening to her lecture, I was able to recall everything
                  better and expand my knowledge base. All the best to the GS
                  community and Mentor Kanak Sengar .
                </p>

                  Very well organized and conceived. By following the course, I'm
                  able to learn & build on the concepts. The course exceeded my
                  expectations in many regards - especially the access to our
                  instructor (Kanak di). She was excellent and her knowledge of
                  not just the course material, but related subjects as well!! I
                  really enjoyed this session, and looking forward to taking more
                  such sessions.
